# Panic Button (ver.1)

Panic button app that sends the sms to the number saved. Uses Google's API for location. 100% Material Design. Thoroughly commented and readable code.

Placing it here as a little portfolio for my CV - as I'd like to write great apps for a living.

It is literally the initial commit as for now app made some leap forward â€” added adbanners and in app purchases;), homescreen widget functionality.

Current version is here - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dobrowins.anon.panicpanic

Right now working on additional functionality - so install and stay tuned! (though wish nor you, nor you siblings would never need app like this)
